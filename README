For Message bus or CQRS we need this package

composer require symfony/messenger

Need monolog bundle for log

composer require symfony/monolog-bundle

composer require symfony/serializer --This is require for auto map request to dto

composer require symfony/validator --This is require for request validation.

composer require lexik/jwt-authentication-bundle --This is require for request validation

bin/console lexik:jwt:generate-keypair --This is for key generation Your keys will land in config/jwt/private.pem and config/jwt/public.pem (unless you configured a different path).

    --skip-if-exists will silently do nothing if keys already exist.
    --overwrite will overwrite your keys if they already exist.

composer require symfony/security-bundle --This is needed for authorization
That will also pull in symfony/security-core and friends automatically.
